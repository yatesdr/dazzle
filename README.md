A simple audio sample player consisting of a LaunchPad Mini, a Raspberry Pi 4.

This project was originally designed for playing "walk-on" music for Softball games.


## How to use
1 - Print the STL's
2 - Wire up your system
3 - Install Raspbian 64 bit
4 - Install Docker (sudo apt install docker.io)
5 - Build the docker image, or use the public one.
6 - Download your Media.   WAV files work the best.   Convert them if necessary
7 - Edit app.py and modify the config area to reflect the board layout you want.
8 - Run the docker file at boot using restart=always.
